    "## 1. Write a Summary Program\n",
    "Write a program that can print a summary of an institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Python code should do the following _in a loop_:\n",
    "1. Prompt the user to enter the name of a school, or \"quit\" to stop.\n",
    "1. Run a database query that joins both tables to retrieve these facts about the school the user entered:\n",
    "  * **from usnews data** displayName, overallRank, enrollment, businessRepScore (OK if None), engineeringRepScore (OK if None)\n",
    "  * **from ipeds_2018 data** city, stabbr, chfnm, chftitle, gentele, webaddr    \n",
    "  You need to figure out what column values the tables have in common to be able to do this.\n",
    "3. Print a nicely formatted summary of the school containing all the facts you just retrieved.  See below for an example. \n",
    "4. **Add the code for this step only after you've finished the previous ones.** If there are no schools in your results, print a message saying \"Cannot find a school with that name.\"  This is worth only one point, so if you can't get it, it's not a huge deal.  Hint:  Consider your existing code.  Create a variable that you initialize outside your loop to print your results.  Change that variable inside the loop somehow.  If *after the loop is finished* the value of the variable hasn't changed, it means that there were no rows to iterate through to print.\n",
